# Moving_Ball_Dataset
The videos are captured by CMOS image sensor in grayscale mode. 
Five types of ball movement are included: up, down, left, right, and blank. 
The size of video files is small enough for data importation in MATLAB or Python environment. 
Customized datasets for diverse AI applications can be further developed based on those videos by imitating various sensor behaviors. 
In the folders, both raw videos and the labeled short clips of 1s are provided. 
All the contained files are open source for non-profit use to any researchers in need, in the condition that the original source is declared.
