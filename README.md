# Moving_Ball_Dataset
The videos are captured by CMOS image sensor in grayscale mode.
It including five types ball movement classes: up, down, left, right and blank.
The size of all videos are small enough for data importation in MATLAB or Python environment. 
A customized moving_ball_dataset for AI application could extract from video by simulating various sensors behviors.
After marking the orginal source, all the videos are open_source to anyone who need them for non-profit use.
